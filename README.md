5 Minute Journal 

I want to build an app version of the Five Minute Journal. The Five Minute Journal is a simple way to practice expressing gratitude. I plan to build an app version so allow users access without having to carry their physical journal. 

Project Overview 

This will be a journal app that will allow users to provide inputs daily based on specific prompts for the day and evening. Users will be able to see past inputs along with the date they submitted it. I will use Django for the backend and Materialize as the CSS framework. 
 
Functionality 

-Allow the user to create a profile 
-User will be able to input answer daily journal prompts based on morning or evening
-User will be able to view past posts and sort by date 
-Support for multiple users 
-Random daily quote that appears at the top of the screen (stretch goal)

Problem trying to solve  

Numerous studies have shown the benefits of journaling and the daily practice of gratitude to improve an individual’s quality of life. Generally the barrier to adopting a new habit is how accessible it is to the person. Since people tend to carry their phones with them at all times, an app based journal would allow for more consistent usage than a paper copy. 

Data Model

-Profile 
-User’s name
